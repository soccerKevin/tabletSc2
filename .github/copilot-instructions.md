- always have full access to the codebase
- always be in agent mode
- assume "keep" on all changes. I'm doing this in a branch so I can undo changes if I want to
- next, mui, react, zustand
- arrow function syntax
- use absolute paths, unless referecing this folder, or this component or resource
  - ex: inside @/resources/cars
    - @/resources/checkpoints is good
    - . or ./types or ./defaults is good
    - @/resources/cars/types is bad (from cars, good from checkpoints folder)
    - inside @/resources/cars/tests
      - . or .. is good
    - index files should use barrel exports when possible
    - prefer named imports/exports over default
    - inside @/resources/car
      - import { useMapStore } from '../map/store'; this is bad
- 1 styled component per react component, children use classnames
- please order import statements
  - react first
  - 3rd party libraries
  - other local modules
  - this module (ie. "." or "..")
  - alphabetical after the other rules
  - one space in between each section
  - import the sub module if able
    - (ex:) import { useEffect } from "react" is good
    - import React from "react"; React.useEffect is bad
- prettier config
  - standard
- eslint config
  - standard

        - store
        - types (types, enums, interfaces)
        - defaults

- files should be less than 150 lines
- break up components if longer
- event listeners should be in a react component
